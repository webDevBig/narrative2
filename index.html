        <h2 class="h2_title">To our readers:</h2>
        <p class="text">For the last century and a half, The Crimson has been committed to holding power to account at
            Harvard University, informing our readers while training the next generation of journalists. For most of our
            history, printing a daily paper was the fastest and most impactful way to fulfill that purpose.</p>
        <p class="text">Our mission — which has survived war, depression, and pandemic — remains fundamental and
            unchanged. But the form through which we fulfill it must be flexible.</p>
        <p class="text">Over the past two decades, our newspaper — and the journalism industry — has raced to keep up
            with the pace of the internet, where content is delivered faster and more creatively than it was when our
            presses first ran in 1873.<br>
            Today, an overwhelming majority of our readers interact with our content online. We must lead the way in
            embracing that reality.</p>
        <p class="text">This fall, The Crimson will make a historic change to harness the opportunity presented by the
            digital era: We will shift to producing a weekly print edition while recentering our operations and product
            to prioritize online content.</p>
        <p class="text">We understand the significance of this change: The University Daily will no longer appear daily
            in print. But this isn’t a move away from our commitment to covering Harvard every day — it is a step into
            the future that will allow us to improve the substance and delivery of our product while better serving our
            staff.</p>
        <p class="text">Producing high-quality independent journalism today requires an innovative digital-first
            approach. This change will allow us to invest our resources into meeting our readers where they are: online.
            And to prepare the next generation of journalists, we must train them on the tools of tomorrow — no longer
            just a broadsheet newspaper.</p>
        <p class="text">Undoubtedly, there remains an important role for print at The Crimson, which will take a new and
            improved form. In the fall, Issue No. 72 of the 149th Volume will come in a brand new weekly format that
            will be redesigned and expanded to include our best journalism, complete with the original reporting,
            analysis, and opinion our readers expect. Online, we will remain a daily news operation as we extend our
            commitment to providing minute-by-minute information to the communities of Harvard and Cambridge on our
            digital platforms.</p>
        <p class="text">On the day The Crimson celebrated its 60th anniversary in 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Class
            of 1904 — president of The Crimson three decades earlier — was being inaugurated to a higher post. A group
            of editors hosting a celebratory dinner anxiously awaited word from FDR, whose universally famous acronym
            first began at The Crimson, where it is still a tradition to call each other by our initials. Shortly before
            the dinner, Roosevelt sent a telegram apologizing for his absence. “I’m sorry that I cannot attend your
            celebration,” he wired. “Keep the old sheet flying.”</p>
        <p class="text">Those words have served as the unofficial motto of​​​​ The Crimson ever since. With this change,
            we will seek to turn the challenge of our time into the opportunity of our new era and keep the old sheet
            flying for 150 more years.</p>
        <p class="text">Sincerely,
            Raquel Coronell Uribe ’22-’23President of the 149th Guard<br>
            Jasper G. Goodman ’23Managing Editor of the 149th Guard<br>

        <p class="text">As college students, we are accustomed to going to class, taking down information, processing
            it, completing assignments, applying the information gathered, and then doing it all over again the next
            day. It can be time-consuming, stressful, and draining. You’re probably thinking, “Well, what can I do as a
            way to wind down?’ The answer to that question is quite simple. Watching interesting TV on streaming
            platforms can be just the distraction that you need. With a little help from our Instagram fans, down below
            is a list of The Buccaneer's top 10 most binge-worthy series. </p>

        <h2 class="h2_title red">2. Stranger Things</h2>
        <p class="text">If teen drama isn’t necessarily your cup of tea, then you might find more interest in the second
            show on our list. Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in the early 1980s, the show follows a young
            girl, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), after she escapes from a secret government co-op. This show is a great
            one to watch, especially if you’re the type of person who enjoys horror/thriller-themed shows. </p>

        <p class="text">For those who enjoy the supernatural but need a little more romance/drama and a bit less
            DemiGorgons and Russian spies, then number three on our list is the show for you. Surrounding a complicated
            love triangle between a teenage girl and two immortal vampire brothers in the world of vampires, werewolves,
            and witches, it’s easy to see how this eight-season show became as popular as it did. Featuring a strong
            female protagonist, Nina Dobrev manages to portray a variety of emotions.</p>
